# Backend of Lunch Ordering System Template

## Requirements

You'll need the following software installed to get started.

  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer for your OS.
  - [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads): Use the installer for your OS.
    - Windows users can also try [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).

Install the dependencies. If you're running Mac OS or Linux, you may need to run `sudo npm install` instead, depending on how your machine is configured.

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

While you're working on your project, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the Sass and assemble your Node.js app. **Now go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see it in action.** 

To run the compiling process once, without watching any files, use the `build` command.

```bash
npm start build
```
